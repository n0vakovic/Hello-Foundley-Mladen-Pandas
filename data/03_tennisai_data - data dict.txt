* p1_points - Player 1 points in the current game;
* p1_set1 - Games that player 1 won in the first set (-1 if the set is still not finished). This was introduced when used for score tracking when the full scoreboard is used by broadcaster (full scoreboard - the result of each set is always shown) and there’s no reason to discard this information now that’s available;

* p1_set5 - Same;
* p2, p2_sets, p2_games, p2_points, p2_set1, p2_set2, p2_set3, p2_set4, p2_set5 - Same but for player 2;
* server - Current server;
* vid_second - Timestamp in seconds;
* point_duration - Point duration (currently calculated just as a difference between two consecutive points timestamps);

List of columns derived from a separate algorithm (ball hit detection from audio):
* detected_ballhit_count - number of ball hits detected
* strokes_timestamps - timestamps when the ball hits were detected
